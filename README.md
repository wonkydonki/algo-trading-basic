# algo-trading-basic
Three basic algorithmic trading projects to get me started.
This repository follows closely along with the online course on **Algorithmic Trading in Python** hosted by freeCodeCamp, as shown in the repository here: https://github.com/nickmccullum/algorithmic-trading-python/tree/master
- Mini-project 1: Building An Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund   
- Mini-project 2: Building A Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy
- Mini-project 3: Building A Quantitative Value Investing Strategy
P.S.
- IEX Cloud stopped wroking, so I have used FMP API instead in my code.
- Google Colab mounting and integration with the notebook is a pain so I have just written code blocks in a Kaggle notebook instead and committed those here. Basic functionality should remain the same though keep in mind the data paths and secrets updates that WILL BE NEEDED for your own runs of this project.
